# Exercise 3

In this lab exercise we learned about the following:
- How to use the Scene Builder to create a GUI
- How to use the FXML file to create a GUI
- how to create a controller class to add functionality to the GUI
- How to use application class to launch the GUI
- Understand how to handle events in the GUI

- Create a new application that can show different types of flowerss

## Main
This is basically 'BeautifulFlowersApp.java' which is the main class that launches the GUI and 'BeautifulFlowersController.java' which is the controller class that handles the events in the GUI.
The 'FXML' file is 'BeautifulFlowers.fxml' which is used to create the GUI.

This is base on design language given to us in the lab exercise by the instructor.

## Improvement
This is a new application based on different design language. The GUI is created using Scene Builder and the 'FXML' file is 'BeautifulFlowers-improvedView.fxml'. The controller class is 'BeautifulFlowersImprovedController.java' and the main class is 'BeautifulFlowersImprovedApp.java'.
